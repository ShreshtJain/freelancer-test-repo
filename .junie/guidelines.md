# Project Guidelines

* We always use the latest version of Spring boot, so use new features like the
  RestClient instead of RestTemplate and JDBCClient instead of JdbcTemplate
* Use the latest features of Kotlin if it makes sense
* do not check or write tests.
* Do not use comments, the code should be self-explanatory
